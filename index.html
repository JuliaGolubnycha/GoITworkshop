              Because it holds the key to unlocking my lifelong dream
            </h1>
            <p class="content_text">
              Ever since I was a child, I gazed up at the night sky with wonder,
              dreaming of becoming an astronomer. The mysteries of the cosmos,
              the allure of exploring distant galaxies – they captivated me like
              nothing else. But as I grew older, I realized that the path to
              becoming an astronomer had shifted. It wasn't just about
              stargazing and uncovering the secrets of the universe; it was
              about mastering complex mathematics and data analysis. Yet, rather
              than deter me, this realization ignited a new passion within me. I
              saw an opportunity to merge my love for exploration with the
              practical skills of software development. By becoming a developer,
              I can create the very tools that astronomers rely on to push the
              boundaries of our understanding. I can write code that powers
              telescopes, analyzes astronomical data, and fuels the quest to
              unravel the mysteries of the cosmos. In the realm of technology, I
              see endless possibilities to contribute to humanity's exploration
              of the galaxy. And that is why I have chosen the IT sphere –
              because it allows me to pursue my childhood dream in a way I never
              imagined possible.

        When you hear that someone is a programmer, you usually imagine a person
        creating modern websites or games, or doing incredibly boring tasks by
        writing symbols that are hard to understand. But is that really the
        case? I bet not!

          <p class="fact_1_desc">
            Imagine this: I'm the maestro of the universe, conducting symphonies
            of space exploration from the comfort of my coding chair. With a
            stroke of my keyboard, I launch majestic space ships into the great
            unknown.

            Not only do I write impressive code to manage every aspect of the
            voyage – from navigation to life support to keeping the coffee warm
            – but I also dabble in spaceship architecture. Yes, you heard it
            right. I'm the architect of the stars, crunching numbers and
            designing vessels that even aliens would envy.

            a laptop and a whole lot of caffeine. But hey, every great adventure
            starts with a lone pioneer, right? So, picture this: I'm on the
            lookout for a team of fellow cosmic dreamers – the kind of people
            who believe that reaching for the stars isn't just a metaphor.

        a spark of starlight to your team, look no further. I'm ready to
        launch into the unknown and turn our collective dreams into
        celestial realities!</p>
